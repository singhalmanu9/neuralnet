# Abhimanyu Singhal's Neural Net(s)

This is the repository that contains the source code for any neural nets I have or will make. This code is designed for Processing, a Java environment that has easy to use graphics features. To my knowledge, no such library existed for Processing, so I decided to just make my own. 

Currently, there are two neural net programs in this repository. processing_ff_nn is a simple feedfoward neural network that can accept inputs, provide an guess, and improve its accuracy via backpropagation. neat_nn was intended to be an implementation of NEAT (Neuroevolution of Adapting Topologies) for Processing, but the project is currently on hold. 

I have used the feedforward net in conjunction with a genetic algorithm to make an AI that learns to play Flappy Bird (or at least, my remade version of it). To see it running in the browser, visit [my site](https://singhalmanu9.github.io/p5-fun/flappy.html). To view the source code, visit [the project on Github](https://github.com/singhalmanu9/flappy_bird_ai).
